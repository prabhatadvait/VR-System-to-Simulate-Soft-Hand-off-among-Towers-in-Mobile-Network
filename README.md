# VR-System-to-Simulate-Soft-Hand-off-among-Towers-in-Mobile-Network
Our project, VR System to Simulate Soft Hand-off among Towers in Mobile Networks, aimed to create an immersive simulation of mobile network handoff between towers. A team of five members worked collaboratively to model a 3D representation of a city, complete with mobile towers (base stations) and cars driving at high speeds.We implemented four different mathematical models running in the background to simulate mobile handoffs, considering various factors like signal strength, distance, and interference. The project demonstrates the process of handoff from tower to tower with physical signal propagation, showcasing real-time changes as the vehicles move through different network zones. This system provides a valuable tool for understanding mobile network behavior and optimizing handoff processes in urban environments.
