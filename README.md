# VR-System-to-Simulate-Soft-Hand-off-among-Towers-in-Mobile-Network
Our project, VR System to Simulate Soft Hand-off among Towers in Mobile Networks, aimed to create an immersive simulation of mobile network handoff between towers. A team of five members worked collaboratively to model a 3D representation of a city, complete with mobile towers (base stations) and cars driving at high speeds.
